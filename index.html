						Bustling Durban is the hub of the Kwa-Zulu Natal’s business and industry and pulses with all the energy of a major port city. Luxury hotels abound on Durban’s beachfront, and this city is often referred to as South Africa’s Miami Beach.
						Durban is one of the fastest-growing urban areas in the world.
						Its port is the busiest in South Africa and also one of the 10 largest in the world.
						Durban is blessed with balmy weather all year round, making it a perfect holiday paradise.
